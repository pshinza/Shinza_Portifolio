This code was part of a project that I had to do for my class of introduction to computational inteligence.
First I wanted to train my own CNN to solve the problem of classifying images of cats, dogs and monkeys.
But the ideia of a deep learning project on the course was new and we had little time to implement anything.
So, I choose to retrain the googlenet using the neural networks toolbox of MATLAB by transfer learning.
The ideia is to retrain only the last layers of the network.
As result, the accuracy was of 100% although the time of training was very small, less than 5 minutes.

Sadly, I didn't have time to translate the documentation of my work to english, but they are available in portuguese in my git.
